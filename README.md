# Project Todos

This project was about learning how to structure a redux store, how to write reducers and actions and how to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions.

## The problem

I started the project by sketching out what components I wanted and what each of them should do and how they would be connected to each other. Then I continued by coding along to lectures about reducers, actions and selectors. I also looked at older projects to refresh my memory about the structure of different react hooks such as useState. I had some troubles with pathways for my icons and background image but I got help with that after I hade posted a question at stackOverflow. I also got help with how to count the uncompleted todos by searching at stackOverflow. I looked at a lot of different suggestions about styling checkboxes and went fo a mix in the end. I still think it's difficult with that kind of styling since it's a lot of code to understand and write. If I had more time I would have digged deeper into understanding the structure of redux store, reducers and actions.
